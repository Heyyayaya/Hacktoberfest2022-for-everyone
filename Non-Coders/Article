Why do you think Billionaires are funding the massive treasure hunts in Greenland? Do the Treasure really exist? 
Okay! Let's Get into the Story...
A Gigantic treasure hunt on the west-coast of Greenland, with helicopters and transmitters is being funded by some of the richest people in the world. The Billionaire Club including Jeff Bezos, Michael Bloomberg and Bill Gates are financially backing Kobold Metals, a mineral exploration company and California-based startup. It has partnered with Bluejay Mining to find the rare and precious metals in Greenland.
The climate crisis in Greenland at an unprecedented rate has opened new doors for the investors and mining companies , who are looking for a trove of critical minerals capable of powering the green energy transition. The Billionaire club is betting that below the surface of the hills and valleys on Greenland's Disko Island and Nuussuaq Peninsula  , there are enough critical minerals to power hundreds of millions of electric vehicles.
Melting ice is exposing land that has been buried under ice for centuries to millennia which can become potential site for mineral exploration. The researchers are taking soil samples , flying drones and helicopters to measure the electromagnetic field of the subsurface and map the layers of rock below. They are using artificial intelligence to analyze the data to pinpoint exactly where to drill , as early as next summer.
 According to the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland , Greenland could be a hot spot for coal,copper,gold,ainc and rare-earth elements. Even the Government of Greenland supports the responsible, sustainable and economical development of their natural resources to include mining of a broad range of minerals.
